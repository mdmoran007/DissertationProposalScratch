This is really just some odds and ends for my dissertation research, to keep it sync'd between a few computers.
The research is looking at the text-mining of the CEO's Letter from the Annual Reports of S&P 500 companies from 2005 to 2019.
I am looking at the impact of ESG on primary stakeholder language.
As the work evolves, I'll move from content analysis to higher-level ideas.
I've also included some company demographics and performance data to understand moderating/mediating factors better.
